### Problem to Approach
- From problem to approach
    - **What is the problem that you are trying to solve?**
    - **How can you use data to answer the question?**
- Working with data
    - **What data do you need to answer the question?**
    - **Where is the data coming from (identify all sources) and how will you get it?**
    - **Is the data that you collected representative of the problem to be solved?**
    - **What additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data?**
- Deriving the answer
    - **In what way can the data be visualized to get to the answer that is required?**
    - **Does the model used really answer the initial question or does it need to be adjusted?**
    - **Can you put the model into practice?**
    - **Can you get constructive feedback into answering the question?**
- CRISP-DM Model
    - Business Understanding
        - Seek clarification
        - Define Goals and Objectives
        - Next â†’ Analytical Approach
    - Data Understanding
    - Data Preparation
    - Modeling
    - Evaluation
    - Deployment

### From Requirements to Collection
- Data Requirements
- Data Collection

### From Understanding to Preparation
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Data quality
    - Missing values
    - Invalid or misleading values

### From Modeling to Evaluation
- Modeling
    - Developing models that are descriptive or predictive
    - Understanding the question is key to building a good model
- Evaluation
    - ROC Curve
        - True-Positive Rate vs False-Positive Rate
        - Optimal model at maximum separation

### From Deployment to Feedback
- Assimilate knowledge for business
- Practical understanding of the meaning of model results
- Feedback
    - Used to refine the model
