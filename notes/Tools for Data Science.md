# Tools for Data Science Notes

### Languages of Data Science
- Languages: Python, R, SQL
    - __Python__
        - Computing: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib
        - AI: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn
        - Can be used for NLP and Natural Language Toolkit
    - __R__ (Free Software)
        - Array-oriented syntax
    - __SQL__ (Structured Query Language)
        - Used for handling structured data, data incorporating relations among entities and variables
        - Interpreter between you and the database
        - Many SQL Databases available
            - MySQL, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle Database, MariaDB...
    - Other Languages
        - __Java__
            - For Data Science: Weka (data mining), Java-ML (ml library), Apache MLlib (scalable ml), and Deeplearning4j
            - Hadoop manages data processing and storage for big data applications running in clustered systems
        - __Scala__
            - Apache Spark
        - __C++__
            - Data Science: Tensor Flow built by C++
            - MongoDB is a NOSQL database for big data management
            - Caffe is a deep learning algorithm repository
        - __Java__ Script
            - Data Science: TensorFlow.js 
        - __Julia__ (in 2012)
            - Speed development like Python or R but also programs that run as fast as C or Fortran programs
            - JuliaDB: working with large data sets

### Data Science Tools
- __Data Management__ - process of persisting and retrieving data
    - MySQL, Apache Cassandra, CouchDB, CEPH
- __Data Integration and Transformation__ - process of retrieving data from remote data management systems (ETL: Extract, Transfer, and Load)
    - "Data Refining and Cleaning"
    - Apache Airflow, Kube Flow, Apache Kafka, Node-Red
- __Data Visualization__
    - Hue, Kibana, Apache Superset
- __Model Building__ - process of creating a machine learning or deep learning model using an appropriate algorithm
- __Model Deployment__ - machine learning or deep learning model available to third-party applications
    - Apache PredictionIO, Seldon, mleadp, TensorFlow Service
- __Model Monitoring and Assessment__ - ensures checks for accuracy 
    - ModelDB, Prometheus, AI Explainability IBM
- __Code Asset Management__ - versioning and other collaborative features to facilitate teamwork
    - "Version Control"
    - git, Github, GitLab, Bitbucket, 
- __Data Asset Management__ - supports replication, backup and access right management 
    - "Data Lineage"
    - Apache Atlas, ODPI Egeria, kylo
- __Development Environments__ - tools that help the data scientist to implement, execute, test, and deploy their work
    - Jupyter, Jupyter Lab, Apache Zeppelin, R Studio, Spyder
- __Execution Environment__ - tools where data processing, model training, and deployment take place
    - Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Ray (rise-lab by UC Berkeley)
- __Fully Integrated Visual Tools__ - has first three integrated already
    - Knime and orange
